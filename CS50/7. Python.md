## [Welcome!](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/6/#welcome)

-   In previous weeks, you were introduced to the fundamental building blocks of programming.
-   You learned about programming in a lower-level programming language called C.
-   Today, we are going to work with a higher-level programming language called  _Python_.
-   As you learn this new language, you’re going to find that you are going to be more able to teach yourself new programming languages.

## [Python](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/6/#python)

-   Humans, over the decades, have seen how previous design decisions could be improved upon.
-   Python is a programming language that builds upon what you have already learned in C.

## [Hello](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/6/#hello)

-   Up until this point, the code has looked like this:
    
    ```c
    // A program that says hello to the world
    
    #include <stdio.h>
    
    int main(void)
    {
        printf("hello, world\n");
    }
    
    ```
    
-   Today, you’ll find that the process of writing and compiling code has been simplified.
-   For example, the above code will be rendered in Python as:
    
    ```python
    # A program that says hello to the world
    
    print("hello, world")
    
    ```
    
    Notice that the semicolon is gone.  
    참고로 C는 `make hello.py`로 컴파일해야하지만, python은 따로 컴파일 할 필요가 없다. 
    
-   In C, you might remember this code:
    
    ```c
    // get_string and printf with %s
    
    #include <cs50.h>
    #include <stdio.h>
    
    int main(void)
    {
        string answer = get_string("What's your name? ");
        printf("hello, %s\n", answer);
    }
    
    ```
    
-   This code is transformed in Python to:
    
    ```python
    # get_string and print, with concatenation
    
    from cs50 import get_string
    
    answer = get_string("What's your name? ")
    print("hello, " + answer)
    
    ```
    
    You can write this code by executing  `code hello.py`  in the terminal window. `code`는 vscode에 새로운 파일을 만드는/파일을 여는 명령어이다. Then, you can execute this code by running  `python hello.py`. Notice how the  `+`  sign concatenates  `"hello, "`  and  `answer`.
    
-   Similarly, you could implement the above code as:
    
    ```python
    # get_string and print, with format strings
    
    from cs50 import get_string
    
    answer = get_string("What's your name? ")
    print(f"hello, {answer}")
    
    ```
    
    Notice how the curly braces allow for the  `print`  function to interpolate the  `answer`  such that  `answer`  appears within.
    print()함수 안에 변수를 넣고 싶으면 **f-string**을 사용하면 된다. f-string은 파이썬 3.6 이상 버전에서만 지원하는 문법으로, `f'문자열 {변수명} 문자열...` 이런 방식으로 쓰면 된다. 
    

## [Types](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/6/#types)

-   Data types in Python do not need to be explicitly declared. For example, you saw how  `answer`  above is a string, but we did not have to tell the interpreter this was the case: It knew on its own.
-   In Python, commonly used types include:
    
    ```
      bool
      float
      int
      str
    
    ```
    
    Notice that  `long`  and  `double`  are missing. Python will handle what data type should be used for larger and smaller numbers.  
    Also no more `string` in python. Instead `str` is used.
    
-   Some other data types in Python include:
    
    ```
      range
      list
      tuple
      dict
      set
    
    ```
    
-   Each of these data types can be implemented in C, but in Python they can be implemented more simply.
- range(n): 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1 까지의 숫자들을 차례로 하나씩 반환한다. 
	- range()의 장점: The advantage of the `range` type over a regular `list` or `tuple` is that **a `range` object will always take the same (small) amount of memory, no matter the size of the range it represents** (as it only stores the `start`, `stop` and `step` values, calculating individual items and subranges as needed).

## [Speller](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/6/#speller)

-   To illustrate this simplicity, let’s type `code dictionary.py` in the terminal window and write code as follows:
    
    ```python
    # Words in dictionary
    words = set() #set를 이용하면 중복값이 제거된다. 
    
    
    def check(word):
        """Return true if word is in dictionary else false"""
        if word.lower() in words:
            return True
        else:
            return False
    
    
    def load(dictionary):
        """Load dictionary into memory, returning true if successful else false"""
        file = open(dictionary, "r")
        for line in file:
            word = line.rstrip() #rstrip(): 각 단어 오른쪽의 개행문자(\n) 제거
            words.add(word)
        file.close()
        return True
    
    
    def size():
        """Returns number of words in dictionary if loaded else 0 if not yet loaded"""
        return len(words)
    
    
    # Free any memory that you've been using (for consistency with problem set 5)
    # python automatically deals with memory for you
    def unload():
        """Unloads dictionary from memory, returning true if successful else false"""
        return True
    
    ```
    
    Notice that there are four functions above. In the  `check`  function, if a  `word`  is in  `words`, it returns  `True`. So much easier than an implementation in C! Similarly, in the  `load`  function the dictionary file is opened. For each line in that file, we add that line to  `words`. Using  `rstrip`, the trailing new line is removed from the added word.  `size`  simply returns the  `len`  or length of  `words`.  `unload`  only needs to return  `True`  because Python handles memory management on its own.
    
-   The above code illustrates why higher-level languages exist: To simplify and allow you to write code more easily.
-   However, speed is a tradeoff. Because C allows you, the programmer, to make decisions about memory management, it may run faster than Python – depending on your code. While C only runs your lines of code, Python runs all the code that comes under the hood with it when you call Python’s built-in functions.
-   You can learn more about functions in the  [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html)

## [Image Recognition](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/6/#image-recognition)

-   Numerous libraries have been written by contributors to Python.
-   You can utilize these libraries in your own code.
-   For example, you could simply import facial recognition utilizing a Python library like  `PIL`.
-   David provided a demo of facial recognition utilizing Python and third-party libraries.
- 그냥 파이썬의 여러 라이브러리를 통해 많은 기능을 구현할 수 있다. 그 중에 안면인식 기능도 있다고 보여주는 예시임. 

## [CS50 Library](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/6/#cs50-library)

-   As with C, the CS50 library can be utilized within Python.
-   The following functions will be of particular use:
    
    ```
      get_float
      get_int
      get_string
    
    ```
    
-   You also have the option of importing only specific functions from the CS50 library as follows:
    
    ```
    from CS50 import get_float, get_int, get_string
    
    ```
- `input()`은 `string`을 반환한다. 그래도 그냥 `int(input())`을 입력하면 되는데 굳이 training wheel을 제공하는 이유: `int(input("number: "))`에 `"바보"`라고 문자열을 입력해버리면 에러가 뜨기 때문이다. 이 경우 `Try - except`구문을 사용해서 처리하면 된다(예시는 아래에 있음). 그러나 이 과정이 복잡하므로 CS50 수업에서 따로 함수를 제공함. 

## [Conditionals](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/6/#conditionals)

-   In C, you might remember a program like this:
    
    ```c
    // Conditionals, Boolean expressions, relational operators
    
    #include <cs50.h>
    #include <stdio.h>
    
    int main(void)
    {
        // Prompt user for integers
        int x = get_int("What's x? ");
        int y = get_int("What's y? ");
    
        // Compare integers
        if (x < y)
        {
            printf("x is less than y\n");
        }
        else if (x > y)
        {
            printf("x is greater than y\n");
        }
        else
        {
            printf("x is equal to y\n");
        }
    }
    
    ```
    
-   In Python, it would appear as follows:
    
    ```python
    # Conditionals, Boolean expressions, relational operators
    
    from cs50 import get_int
    
    # Prompt user for integers
    x = get_int("What's x? ")
    y = get_int("What's y? ")
    
    # Compare integers
    if x < y:
        print("x is less than y")
    elif x > y:
        print("x is greater than y")
    else:
        print("x is equal to y")
    
    ```
    
    Notice that there are no more curly braces. Instead, indentations are utilized. Second, a colon is utilized in the  `if`  statement. Further,  `elif`  replaces  `else if`. Parentheses are also no longer required in the  `if`  and  `elif`  statements.
    

## [Variables](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/6/#variables)

-   Variable declaration is simplified too. In C, you might have  `int counter = 1;`. In Python, this same line would read  `counter = 1`. You need not declare the type of the variable.
-   Python favors  `counter += 1`  to increment by one, losing the ability found in C to type  `counter++`.

## [Loops](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/6/#loops)

-   Loops in Python are very similar to C. You may recall the following code in C:
    
    ```c
    // Demonstrates while loop
    
    #include <stdio.h>
    
    int main(void)
    {
        int i = 0;
        while (i < 3)
        {
            printf("meow\n");
            i++;
        }
    }
    
    ```
    
-   In Python, this code appears as:
    
    ```python
    # Demonstrates while loop
    
    i = 0
    while i < 3:
        print("meow")
        i += 1
    
    ```
    
-   `for`  loops can be implemented in Python as follows:
    
    ```python
    # Better design
    
    for i in range(3):
        print("meow")
    
    ```
    
-   Similarly, one could express the above code as:
    
    ```python
    # Abstraction with parameterization
    
    def main():   # 코드 본문 
        meow(3)
    
    
    # Meow some number of times
    def meow(n):   # 사용자 정의 함수
        for i in range(n):
            print("meow")
    
    
    main()   # 코드 본문 실행
    
    ```    
    Notice that a function is utilized to abstract away the meowing.  
    
- 참고:  python에서는 function prototype을 지원하지 않는다. 
	```c
	void meow(int n); //function prototype
	    
	int main(void)  
	{
		 meow(3);
	}
	    
	void meow(int n)
	{
		for (int i; i<n; i++)
		{
			printf("meow");
		}
	}
	```
	    

## [Calculator](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/6/#calculator)

-   We can implement a simple calculator just as we did within C. Type  `code calculator.py`  into the terminal window and write code as follows:
    
    ```python
    # Addition with int [using get_int]
    
    from cs50 import get_int
    
    # Prompt user for x
    x = get_int("x: ")
    
    # Prompt user for y
    y = get_int("y: ")
    
    # Perform addition
    print(x + y)
    
    ```
    
    Notice how the CS50 library is imported. Then,  `x`  and  `y` are gathered from the user. Finally, the result is printed. Notice that the  `main`  function that would have been seen in a C program is gone entirely! While one could utilize a  `main`  function, it is not required.
    
-   It’s possible for one to remove the training wheels of the CS50 library. Modify your code as follows:
    
    ```python
    # Addition with int [using input]
    
    # Prompt user for x
    x = input("x: ")
    
    # Prompt user for y
    y = input("y: ")
    
    # Perform addition
    print(x + y)
    
    ```
    
    Notice how executing the above code results in strange program behavior. Why might this be so?
    
-   You may have guessed that the interpreter understood  `x`  and  `y`  to be **strings**. You can fix your code by employing the  `int`  function as follows:
    
    ```python
    # Addition with int [using input]
    
    # Prompt user for x
    x = int(input("x: "))
    
    # Prompt user for y
    y = int(input("y: "))
    
    # Perform addition
    print(x + y)
    
    ```
    
    Notice how the input for  `x`  and  `y`  is passed to the  `int`  function which converts it to an integer.
    
-   We can expand the abilities of our calculator. Modify your code as follows:
    
    ```python
    # Division with integers, demonstration lack of truncation
    
    # Prompt user for x
    x = int(input("x: "))
    
    # Prompt user for y
    y = int(input("y: "))
    
    # Divide x by y
    z = x / y
    print(z)
    
    ```
    
    Notice that executing this code results in a value, but that if you were to see more digits after  `.333333`  you’d see that we are faced with  **_floating-point imprecision_**.
- floating-point imprecision(부동 소수점 부정확성): float에서 저장 가능한 비트 수가 유한하기 때문에 부정확한 결과가 나옴. ex. `1/3 = 0.333333333333333338790489017859068234..` 
 
-   We can reveal this imprecision by modifying our codes slightly:
    
    ```python
    # Floating-point imprecision
    
    # Prompt user for x
    x = int(input("x: "))
    
    # Prompt user for y
    y = int(input("y: "))
    
    # Divide x by y
    z = x / y
    print(f"{z:.50f}")
    
    ```
    
    Notice that this code reveals the imprecision. Python still faces this issue, just as C does.
    

## [Compare](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/6/#compare)

-   In C, we faced challenges when we wanted to compare two values. Consider the following code:
    
    ```c
    // Conditionals, Boolean expressions, relational operators
    
    #include <cs50.h>
    #include <stdio.h>
    
    int main(void)
    {
        // Prompt user for integers
        int x = get_int("What's x? ");
        int y = get_int("What's y? ");
    
        // Compare integers
        if (x < y)
        {
            printf("x is less than y\n");
        }
        else if (x > y)
        {
            printf("x is greater than y\n");
        }
        else
        {
            printf("x is equal to y\n");
        }
    }
    
    ```
    
-   In Python, we can execute the above as follows:
    
    ```python
    # Conditionals, Boolean expressions, relational operators
    
    from cs50 import get_int
    
    # Prompt user for integers
    x = get_int("What's x? ")
    y = get_int("What's y? ")
    
    # Compare integers
    if x < y:
        print("x is less than y")
    elif x > y:
        print("x is greater than y")
    else:
        print("x is equal to y")
    
    ```
    
    Notice that the CS50 library is imported. Further, minor changes exist in the  `if`  statement.
    
-   Further looking at comparisons, consider the following code in C:
    
    ```c
    // Logical operators
    
    #include <cs50.h>
    #include <stdio.h>
    
    int main(void)
    {
        // Prompt user to agree
        char c = get_char("Do you agree? ");
    
        // Check whether agreed
        if (c == 'Y' || c == 'y')
        {
            printf("Agreed.\n");
        }
        else if (c == 'N' || c == 'n')
        {
            printf("Not agreed.\n");
        }
    }
    
    ```
    
-   The above can be implemented as follows:
    
    ```python
    # Logical operators
    
    from cs50 import get_string
    
    # Prompt user to agree
    s = get_string("Do you agree? ")
    
    # Check whether agreed
    if s == "Y" or s == "y":
        print("Agreed.")
    elif s == "N" or s == "n":
        print("Not agreed.")
    
    ```
    
    Notice that the two vertical bars utilized in C is replaced with  `or`. Indeed, people often enjoy Python because it is more readable by humans. Also, notice that  `char`  does not exist in Python. Instead,  `str`s are utilized.
    
-   Another approach to this same code could be as follows:
    
    ```python
    # Logical operators, using lists
    
    from cs50 import get_string
    
    # Prompt user to agree
    s = get_string("Do you agree? ")
    
    # Check whether agreed
    if s in ["y", "yes"]:  # 'y' or 'yes'를 리스트로 표현
        print("Agreed.")
    elif s in ["n", "no"]:
        print("Not agreed.")
    
    ```
    
    Notice how we are able to express multiple keywords like  `y`  and  `yes`.
    

## [Object-Oriented Programming](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/6/#object-oriented-programming)

-   Up until this point, our programs in this course have been linear: sequential.
-   It’s possible to have certain types of values not only have properties or attributes inside of them but have functions as well. In Python, these values are known as  _objects_
-   In C, we could create a  `struct`  where you could associate multiple variables inside a single self-created data type. In Python, we can do this and also include functions in a self-created data type. When a function belongs to a specific  _object_, it is known as a  _method_.  
<img src = "https://i.esdrop.com/d/f/Hn3cQpRVXY/ixzecnSg7i.png"/>

-   For example,  `strs`  in Python have a built-in  _methods_. Therefore, you could modify your code as follows:
    
    ```python
    # Logical operators, using lists
    
    from cs50 import get_string
    
    # Prompt user to agree
    s = get_string("Do you agree? ")
    
    # Check whether agreed
    if s.lower() in ["y", "yes"]:
        print("Agreed.")
    elif s.lower() in ["n", "no"]:
        print("Not agreed.")
    
    ```
    
    Notice how we are able to express multiple keywords like  `y`  and  `yes`  and convert any user input to lowercase.
    
-   This could be further simplified as:
    
    ```python
    # Logical operators, using lists
    
    from cs50 import get_string
    
    # Prompt user to agree
    s = get_string("Do you agree? ")
    
    s = s.lower()
    
    # Check whether agreed
    if s in ["y", "yes"]:
        print("Agreed.")
    elif s in ["n", "no"]:
        print("Not agreed.")
    
    ```
    
    Notice how the old value of  `s`  is overwritten with the result of  `s.lower()`.  
    C에서는 `tolower(s)`는 원본 `s`를 변형시킬 것이다. 그러나 python에서는 `s.lower()`은 `s`의 복사본을 변형시키기 때문에 원본은 변하지 않는다. **s is immutable.**
  
    
-   In this class, we will only scratch the surface of Python. Therefore, the  [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/)  will be of particular importance as you continue.
-   You can learn more about string methods in the  [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods)

## [Meow](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/6/#meow)

-   Returning to  `meow.c`  from weeks earlier, recall the following code:
    
    ```c
    // Demonstrates while loop
    
    #include <stdio.h>
    
    int main(void)
    {
        int i = 0;
        while (i < 3)
        {
            printf("meow\n");
            i++;
        }
    }
    
    ```
    
-   The above can be implemented within Python as:
    
    ```python
    # Demonstrates while loop
    
    i = 0
    while i < 3:
        print("meow")
        i += 1
    
    ```
    
-   Similarly, using a  `for`  loop, we can write code as follows:
    
    ```python
    # Better design
    
    for i in range(3):
        print("meow")
    
    ```
    
-   As we hinted at earlier today, you can further improve upon this code using functions. Modify your code as follows:
    
    ```python
    # Abstraction
    
    def main():
        for i in range(3):
            meow()
    
    # Meow once
    def meow():
        print("meow")
    
    
    main()
    
    ```
    
    Notice that the  `meow`  function abstracts away the  `print`  statement. Further, notice that the  `main`  function appears at the top of the file. At the bottom of the file, the  `main`  function is called. By convention, it’s expected that you create a  `main`  function in Python.
    
-   Indeed, we can pass variables between our functions as follows:
    
    ```python
    # Abstraction with parameterization
    
    def main():
        meow(3)
    
    
    # Meow some number of times
    def meow(n):
        for i in range(n):
            print("meow")
    
    
    main()
    
    ```
    
    Notice how  `meow`  now takes a variable  `n`. In the  `main`  function, you can call  `meow`  and pass a value like  `3`  to it. Then,  `meow`  utilizes the value of  `n`  in the  `for`  loop.
    
-   Reading the above code, notice how you, as a C programmer, are able to quite easily make sense of the above code. While some conventions are different, the building blocks you previously learned are very apparent in this new programming language.
    

## [Mario](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/6/#mario)

-   Recall a few weeks ago our challenge of building three blocks on top of one another, like in Mario.
    
    ![three vertical blocks](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/6/cs50Week6Slide073.png "mario blocks")
    
-   In Python, we can implement something akin to this as follows:
    
    ```python
    # Prints a column of 3 bricks with a loop
    
    for i in range(3):
        print("#")
    
    ```
    
-   In C, we had the advantage of a  `do-while`  loop. However, in Python it is convention to utilize a  `while`  loop, as Python does not have a  `do while`  loop. You can write code as follows in a file called  `mario.py`:
    
    ```python
    # Prints a column of bricks, using a helper function to get input
    
    from cs50 import get_int
    
    
    def main():
        height = get_height()
        for i in range(height):
            print("#")
    
    
    def get_height():
        while True:
            n = get_int("Height: ")
            if n > 0:
                return n
    
    
    main()
    
    ```
    
    Notice how the scope of  `n`  is everywhere in the  `get_height`  function once it is assigned a value. Further notice that by convention, there are double spaces between functions.
    
-   We can take away the training wheels of the CS50 library as follows:
    
    ```python
    # Prints a column of bricks, catching exceptions
    
    def main():
        height = get_height()
        for i in range(height):
            print("#")
    
    
    def get_height():
        while True:
            try:
                n = int(input("Height: "))
                if n > 0:
                    return n
            except ValueError:
                print("Not an integer")
    
    
    main()
    
    ```
    
    Notice that  `try`  is utilized to attempt to convert  `n`  to an integer. If it cannot do so, an error is outputted.
    
-   Consider the following image:
    
    ![four horizontal question blocks](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/6/cs50Week6Slide075.png "mario blocks")
    
-   In Python, we could implement by modifying your code as follows:
    
    ```python
    # Prints a row of 4 question marks with a loop
    
    for i in range(4):
        print("?", end="")
    print()
    
    ```
    
    Notice that you can override the behavior of the  `print`  function to stay on the same line as the previous print. 즉, `print()`의 end인자의 기본값은 `\n`이다. 따라서 `print()` 사용시 자동으로 줄바꿈이 되는 것이다. 
    
-   Similar in spirit to previous iterations, we can further simplify this program:
    
    ```python
    # Prints a row of 4 question marks without a loop
    
    print("?" * 4)
    
    ```
    
    Notice that we can utilize  `*`  to multiply the print statement to repeat  `4`  times.
    
-   What about a large block of bricks?
    
    ![three by three block of mario blocks](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/6/cs50Week6Slide078.png "mario blocks")
    
-   To implement the above, you can modify your code as follows:
    
    ```python
    # Prints a 3-by-3 grid of bricks with loops
    
    for i in range(3):
        for j in range(3):
            print("#", end="")
        print()
    
    ```
    
    Notice how one  `for`  loop exists inside another. The  `print`  statement adds a new line at the end of each row of bricks.
- 이렇게도 코드 짤 수 있음
	```python
	for i in range(3):
		print("#" * 3)
		print()
	```
    
-   You can learn more about the  `print`  function in the  [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print)
    

## [Scores](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/6/#scores)

-   `list`s are a data structure within Python.
-   `list`s have built in methods or functions within them.
-   For example, consider the following code:
    
    ```python
    # Averages three numbers using a list and a loop
    
    from cs50 import get_int
    
    # Get scores
    scores = []
    for i in range(3):
        score = get_int("Score: ")
        scores.append(score)
    
    # Print average
    average = sum(scores) / len(scores)
    print(f"Average: {average}")
    
    ```
    
    Notice that you can use the built-in  `append`  method, whereby you can  `append`  the score to the list. Also notice that we use the  `sum`  function to add all elements in the list.
    
-   You can even ultilize the following syntax:
    
    ```python
    # Averages three numbers using a list and a loop with + operator
    
    from cs50 import get_int
    
    # Get scores
    scores = []
    for i in range(3):
        score = get_int("Score: ")
        scores += [score]
    
    # Print average
    average = sum(scores) / len(scores)
    print(f"Average: {average}")
    
    ```
    
    Notice that  `+=`  is utilized to append the score to the list. In this case we place square brackets around  `score`  because **only a  `list`  can be added to another  `list`  using  `+`  or  `+=`.**
    
-   You can learn more about lists in the  [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#sequence-types-list-tuple-range)
-   You can also learn more about  `len`  in the  [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#len)

## [Uppercase](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/6/#uppercase)

-   Similarly, consider the following code:
    
    ```python
    # Uppercases string one character at a time
    
    before = input("Before: ")
    print("After:  ", end="")
    for c in before:
        print(c.upper(), end="")
    print()
    
    ```
    
    Notice that each character is uppercased one at a time.
    
-   Python has a built-in method for  `str`s. You could modify your code as follows:
    
    ```python
    # Uppercases string all at once
    
    before = input("Before: ")
    after = before.upper()
    print(f"After:  {after}")
    
    ```
    
    Notice the  `upper`  method is utilized to uppercase the entire string at once.
    

## [Greet](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/6/#greet)

-   As with C(`int main(int argc, char *argv)`), you can also utilize command-line arguments in python. `sys` library provides a module for command line argument: `argv`. Consider the following code:
    
    ```python
    # Prints a command-line argument
    
    from sys import argv
    
    if len(argv) == 2:
        print(f"hello, {argv[1]}")
    else:
        print("hello, world")
    
    ```
    
    Notice that  `argv[1]`  is printed using a  _formatted string_, noted by the  `f`  present in the  `print`  statement.
    
-   You can print all the arguments in  `argv`  as follows:
    
    ```python
    # Printing command-line arguments, indexing into argv
    
    from sys import argv
    
    for i in range(len(argv)):
        print(argv[i])
    
    ```
    
    Notice that the above will not present the word  `python`  if executed, and the first argument will be the name of the file you are running. You can think of the word  `python`  as being analogous to  `./`  when we were running programs in C.
    
-   You can slice pieces of lists away. Consider the following code:
    
    ```python
    # Printing command-line arguments using a slice
    
    from sys import argv
    
    for arg in argv[1:]:  #slicing the list
        print(arg)
    
    ```
    
    Notice that executing this code will result in the name of the file you are running being sliced away.
    
-   You can learn more about the  `sys`  library in the  [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html)
    

## [Exit Status](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/6/#exit-status)

-   The  `sys`  library also has built-in methods. We can use  `sys.exit(i)`  to exit the program with a specific exit code:
    
    ```python
    # Exits with explicit value, importing sys
    
    import sys
    
    if len(sys.argv) != 2:
        print("Missing command-line argument")
        sys.exit(1)  # 1 반환 후 프로그램 종료
    
    print(f"hello, {sys.argv[1]}")
    sys.exit(0)
    
    ```
    
    Notice that dot-notation is used to utilize the built-in functions of  `sys`.    
    참고: 터미널창에 `echo $?` 치면 마지막으로 종료된 명령어의 종료 상태를 말해주는데, 종료상태란 정상적인 종료0과 비정상적 종료인 0을 제외한 다른 값을 의미한다.  
    

## [Search](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/6/#search)

-   Python can also be utilized to search. In your terminal window, type  `code names.py`  and write code as follows:
    
    ```python
    # Implements linear search for names (선형탐색!!)
    
    import sys
    
    # A list of names
    names = ["Bill", "Charlie", "Fred", "George", "Ginny", "Percy", "Ron"]
    
    # Ask for name
    name = input("Name: ")
    
    # Search for name
    for n in names:
	    if n == name:
	        print("Found")
	        sys.exit(0)
    
    print("Not found")
    sys.exit(1)
    
    ```
    
    Notice that this code functions. Indeed, it implements a **linear search**.
    
-   You can utilize the built-in abilities of Python as follows:
    
    ```py
    # Implements linear search for names using `in`
    
    import sys
    
    # A list of names
    names = ["Bill", "Charlie", "Fred", "George", "Ginny", "Percy", "Ron"]
    
    # Ask for name
    name = input("Name: ")
    
    # Search for name
    if name in names:  # for문 대신 사용
        print("Found")
        sys.exit(0)
    
    print("Not found")
    sys.exit(1)
    
    ```
    
    Notice that the  `in`  preposition is utilized. Python understands how to implement the lower-level code to do a linear search.
    

## [Phonebook](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/6/#phonebook)

-   Recall that a  **_dictionary_**  or  `dict`  is a collection of  **_key_**  and  **_value_**  pairs.
-   You can implement a dictionary in Python as follows:
    
    ```py
    # Implements a phone book
    
    from cs50 import get_string
    
    people = {
        "Carter": "+1-617-495-1000",
        "David": "+1-949-468-2750"
    }
    
    # Search for name
    name = get_string("Name: ")
    if name in people:
        print(f"Number: {people[name]}")
    
    ```
    
    Notice that the dictionary is implemented using curly braces. Then, the statement  `if name in people`  searches to see if the  `name`  is in the  `people`  dictionary. Further, notice how, in the  `print`  statement, we can index into the people dictionary using the value of  `name`. Very useful! -> 이 말 즉슨, 딕셔너리에서는 키(key: 문자열 등)을 인덱스처럼 사용할 수 있다. 
    
-   Python has done their best to get to  **_constant time_  using their built-in searches**.

## [Comparison](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/6/#comparison)

-   We can implement comparisons as follows in Python:
    
    ```py
    # Compares two strings
    
    # Get two strings
    s = input("s: ")
    t = input("t: ")
    
    # Compare strings
    if s == t:
        print("Same")
    else:
        print("Different")
    
    ```
    
    Notice how Python utilizes the  `==`  to be able to compare two variables. Further, notice that Python allows you to compare two strings without examining strings character by character using pointers as in C.
    참고: C에서    
    ```c
    int main(void)
    {
	    char *a = "David"
	    char *b = "David"
	    if (a == b)
	    {
		    printf("a = b")
		}
		else
		{
			print("a!=b")
		}
    }
    ```  
    위 코드의 결과는 무조건 `"a!=b"`이다. 그 이유는 포인터 a와 포인터 b가 참조하는 메모리의 주소가 다르기 때문이다. 각 메모리에 저장된 문자열은 David로 같지만, 주소가 다르기 때문에 a와 b는 다르다고 판단한다. 

## [Swap](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/6/#swap)

-   Further, we can implement a program that swaps values [as we did in C.](https://github.com/Elenaljh/TIL/blob/main/CS50/5.%20%EB%A9%94%EB%AA%A8%EB%A6%AC.md#1-%EC%9E%85%EB%A0%A5%EB%90%9C-%EB%91%90-%EC%A0%95%EC%88%98%EB%A5%BC-%EB%B0%94%EA%BE%B8%EB%8A%94-%ED%95%A8%EC%88%98-swap%EC%9D%84-%EC%9E%91%EC%84%B1%ED%95%B4%EB%B3%B4%EC%9E%90) Consider the following code in Python:
    
    ```py
    # Swaps two integers
    
    x = 1
    y = 2
    
    print(f"x is {x}, y is {y}")
    x, y = y, x
    print(f"x is {x}, y is {y}")
    
    ```
    
    Notice that each value is swapped, using some very  _Pythonic_  syntax  `x, y = y, x`.
    

## [CSV](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/6/#csv)

-   You can also utilize Python to engage with CSV files. Consider the following program called  `phonebook.py`:

    ```py
    # Saves names and numbers to a CSV file
    
    import csv
    
    # Get name and number
    name = input("Name: ")
    number = input("Number: ")
    
    # Open CSV file (참고: csv 파일은 미리 만들어놔야 함)
    with open("phonebook.csv", "a") as file:
    
        # Print to file
        writer = csv.writer(file)
        writer.writerow([name, number])
    
    ```
    
    Notice that utilizing the  `with`  block of code, with the  `writer`  and its work happening below it indented, _prevents us from needing to  `close`  our file once finished._ [`writer`에 대해 잘 모르겠다면](https://python-adv-web-apps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/csv.html?highlight=writer#writing-to-a-csv)
    ```py
    # with open("phonebook.csv", "a") as file: 하지 않으면 코드 이렇게 짬. 
    open("phonebook.csv", "a")
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerow([name, number])
    file.close()
    ```
    
-   Commonly, CSV files have columns that carry specific names. A  `DictWriter`  can used to create the CSV file and assign specific names to each column. -> 이렇게 하면 작성자가 csv 파일(엑셀)에 들어가서 열 순서를 바꿔놔도, head와 data가 연동되므로 데이터가 꼬이지 않음. Consider the following modification to our code:
    
    ```py
    # Saves names and numbers to a CSV file using a DictWriter
    
    import csv
    
    # Get name and number
    name = input("Name: ")
    number = input("Number: ")
    
    # Open CSV file
    with open("phonebook.csv", "a") as file:
    
        # Print to file
        writer = csv.DictWriter(file, fieldnames=["name", "number"])
        writer.writerow({"name": name, "number": number})
    
    ```
    
    Notice the  `name`  and  `number`  columns are defined in the penultimate row of code, and values are added in the final line.
    
-   You can learn more about the CSV files in Python in the  [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html)
    

## [Regular Expressions](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/6/#regular-expressions)

-   Python can be used to analyze patterns of data using  _regular expressions_.
-   Some regular expressions built into Python are as follows:
    
    ```
      .   any character
      .*  0 or more characters
      .+  1 or more characters
      ?   optional
      ^   start of input
      $   end of input
    
    ```
    
-   Our previous program,  `agree.py`  can utilize regular expressions:
    
    ```py
    # Logical operators, using regular expressions
    
    import re
    
    from cs50 import get_string
    
    # Prompt user to agree
    s = get_string("Do you agree? ")
    
    # Check whether agreed
    if re.search("^y(es)?$", s, re.IGNORECASE):
        print("Agreed.")
    elif re.search("^no?$", s, re.IGNORECASE):
        print("Not agreed.")
    
    ```
    
    Notice that the  `^`  means to look at the start of the input for a  `y`. Then, it designates the  `es`  as optional using the parentheses and the  `?`  symbol. Finally, it designates the end of the input with the  `$`  symbol. A similar pattern is used for  `no`.
    
-   You can learn more about the Python regular expression(`re`) library in the  [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html)

## [Speech](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/6/#speech)

-   Using a third-party library, Python can do text-to-speech.
    
    ```py
    # Says hello to someone
    
    import pyttsx3
    
    engine = pyttsx3.init()
    name = input("What's your name? ")
    engine.say(f"hello, {name}")
    engine.runAndWait()
    
    ```
    
-   Further, you can run the following code:
    
    ```py
    # Says "This was CS50"
    
    import pyttsx3
    
    engine = pyttsx3.init()
    engine.say("This was CS50")
    engine.runAndWait()
    
    ```
