## [Welcome!](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/0/#welcome)

-   This class is about more than computer programming!
-   Indeed, this class is about problem-solving in a way that is exceedingly empowering! You will likely take the problem solving that you learn here will likely be instantly applicable to your work beyond this course and even your career as a whole!
-   However, it will not be easy! You will be “drinking from the firehose” of knowledge during this course. You’ll be amazed at what you will be able to accomplish in the coming weeks.
-   This course is far more about you advancing “you” from “where you are today” than hitting some imagined standard.
-   The most important opening consideration in this course: Give the time you need to learn through this course. Everyone learns differently. If something does not work out well at the start, know that with time you will grow and grow in your skill.

## [What’s Ahead](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/0/#whats-ahead)

-   You will be learning this week about Scratch, a visual programming language.
-   Then, in future weeks, you will learn about C. That will look something like this:
    
    ```
      #include <stdio.h>
    
      int main(void)
      {
          printf("hello, world\n");
      }
    
    ```
    
-   Further, as the weeks progress, you will learn about algorithms.
-   You will learn about memory.
-   You will learn about buggy code and what causes computer crashes.
-   You will learn about data structures such as a hash table.
-   Then, we will transition to a new, higher-level language called  _Python_. Your code will look something like this:
    
    ```
      print("hello, world")
    
    ```
    
-   This class will give you a strong understanding of how recent programming languages developed from the earlier ones.
-   We will also be looking at how we can use databases and third-party frameworks to build web applications.

## [Computational Thinking](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/0/#computational-thinking)

-   Essentially, computer programming is about taking some input and creating some output - thus solving a problem. What happens in between the input and output, what we could call  _a black box,_  is the focus of this course.
    
    ![Black box with input and output](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/0/cs50Week0Slide38.png "Black box with input and output")
    
-   For example, we may need to take attendance for a class. We could use a system called  _unary_  to count, one finger at a time. Computers today count using a system called  _binary_. It’s from the term  _binary digit_  that we get a familiar term called  _bit_. A  _bit_  is a zero or one.
-   Computers only speak in terms of zeros and ones. Zeros represent  _off._  Ones represent  _on._  Computers are millions, and perhaps billions, of transistors that are being turned on and off.
-   If you imagine using a light bulb, a single bulb can only count from zero to one.
-   However, if you were to have three light bulbs, there are more options open to you!
-   Using three light bulbs, the following could represent zero:
    
    ```
      0 0 0
    
    ```
    
-   Similarly, the following would represent one:
    
    ```
      0 0 1
    
    ```
    
-   By this logic, we could propose that the following equals two:
    
    ```
      0 1 0
    
    ```
    
-   Extending this logic further, the following represents three:
    
    ```
      0 1 1
    
    ```
    
-   Four would appear as:
    
    ```
      1 0 0
    
    ```
    
-   We could, in fact, using only three light bulbs count as high as seven!
    
    ```
      1 1 1
    
    ```
    
-   As a heuristic, we could imagine that the following values represent each possible place in our  _binary digit_:
    
    ```
      4 2 1
    
    ```
    
-   Computers use ‘base-2’ to count. This can be pictured as follows:
    
    ```
      2^2  2^1  2^0
      4    2    1
    
    ```
    
-   Therefore, you could say that it would require three bits (the four’s place, the two’s place, and the one’s place) to represent a number as high as seven.
    
-   Computers generally use eight bits to represent a number. For example,  `00000101`  is the number 5 in  _binary_.

## [Text](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/0/#text)

-   Just as numbers are binary patterns of ones and zeros, letters are represented using ones and zeros too!
-   Since there is an overlap between the ones and zeros that represent numbers and letters, the  _ASCII_  standard was created to map specific letters to specific numbers.
-   For example, the letter  `A`  was decided to map to the number 65.
-   If you received a text message, the binary under that message might represent the numbers 72, 73, and 33. Mapping these out to ASCII, your message would look as follows:
    
    ```
      H   I   !
      72  73  33
    
    ```
    
-   Thank goodness for standards like ASCII that allow us to agree upon these values!
-   Here is an expanded map of ASCII values:
    
    ![ASCII map](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/0/cs50Week0Slide93.png "ASCII map")
    
-   If you wish, you can learn more about  [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII).

## [Emojis](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/0/#emojis)

-   As time has rolled on, there are more and more ways to communicate via text.
-   Since there were not enough digits in binary to represent all the various characters that could be represented by humans, the  _Unicode_  standard expanded the number of bits that can be transmitted and understood by computers.
-   There are emojis that you probably use every day. The following may look familiar to you:
    
    ![emojis](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/0/cs50Week0Slide103.png "emojis")
    
-   Computer scientists faced a challenge when wanting to assign various skin tones to each emoji to allow the communication to be further personalized. In this case, the creators and contributors of emojis decided that the initial bits would be the structure of the emoji itself, followed by skin tone.
-   More and more features are being added to the Unicode standard to represent further characters and emojis.
-   If you wish, you can learn more about  [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode).
-   If you wish, you can learn more about  [emojis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji).

## [RGB](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/0/#rgb)

-   Red, green, and blue (called  `RGB`) is a combination of three numbers.
    
    ![red green blue boxes](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/0/cs50Week0Slide118.png "red green blue boxes")
    
-   Taking our previously used 72, 73, and 33, which said  `HI!`  via text, would be interpreted by image readers as a light shade of yellow. The red value would be 72, the green value would be 73, and the blue would be 33.
    
    ![yellow box](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/0/cs50Week0Slide120.png "yellow box")
    

## [Images, Video and Sound](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/0/#images-video-and-sound)

-   Images are simply collections of RGB values.
-   Videos are sequences of many images that are stored together, just like a flipbook.
-   Music can be represented through MIDI data.

## [Algorithms](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/0/#algorithms)

-   Problem-solving is central to computer science and computer programming.
-   Imagine the basic problem of trying to locate a single name in a phone book.
-   How might you go about this?
-   One approach could be to simply read from page one to the next to the next until reaching the last page.
-   Another approach could be to search two pages at a time.
-   A final and perhaps better approach could be to go to the middle of the phone book and ask, “Is the name I am looking for to the left or to the right?” Then, repeat this process, cutting the problem in half and half and half.
-   Each of these approaches could be called algorithms. The speed of each of these algorithms can be pictured as follows in what is called  _big-O notation_:
    
    ![big o notation](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/0/cs50Week0Slide141.png "big o notation")  Notice that the first algorithm, highlighted in red, has a big-O of  `n`  because if there are 100 names in the phone book, it could take up to 100 tries to find the correct name. The second algorithm, where two pages were searched at a time, has a big-O of ‘n/2’ because we searched twice as fast through the pages. The final algorithm has a big-O of log2n as doubling the problem would only result in one more step to solve the problem.
    

## [Pseudocode and the Basic Building Blocks of Programming](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/0/#pseudocode-and-the-basic-building-blocks-of-programming)

-   The ability to create  _pseudocode_  is central to one’s success in both this class and in computer programming.
-   Pseudocode is a human-readable version of your code. For example, considering the third algorithm above, we could compose pseudocode as follows:
    
    ```
      1  Pick up phone book
      2  Open to middle of phone book
      3  Look at page
      4  If person is on page
      5      Call person
      6  Else if person is earlier in book
      7      Open to middle of left half of book
      8      Go back to line 3
      9  Else if person is later in book
      10     Open to middle of right half of book
      11     Go back to line 3
      12 Else
      13     Quit
    
    ```
    
-   Pseudocoding is such an important skill for at least two reasons. First, when you pseudocode before you create formal code, it allows you to think through the logic of your problem in advance. Second, when you pseudocode, you can later provide this information to others that are seeking to understand your coding decisions and how your code works.
-   Notice that the language within our pseudocode has some unique features. First, some of these lines begin with verbs like  _pick up,_  _open,_  _look at._  Later, we will call these  _functions_.
-   Second, notice that some lines include statements like  `if`  or  `else if.`  These are called  _conditionals_.
-   Third, notice how there are expressions that can be stated as  _true_  or  _false,_  such as “person is earlier in the book.” We call these  _boolean expressions_.
-   Finally, notice how these statements like “go back to line 3.” We call these  _loops_.
-   In the context of  _Scratch_, which is discussed below, we will use each of the above basic building blocks of programming.

## [Scratch](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/0/#scratch)

-   _Scratch_  is a visual programming language developed by MIT.
-   Scratch utilizes the same essential coding building blocks that we covered earlier in this lecture.
-   Scatch is a great way to get into computer programming because it allows you to play with these building blocks in a visual manner, not having to be concerned about the syntax of curly braces, semicolons, parentheses, and the like.
-   Scatch  `IDE`  (integrated development environment) looks like the following:
    
    ![scratch interface](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/0/cs50Week0Slide162.png "scratch interface")  Notice that on the left, there are  _building blocks_  that you can use in your programming. To the immediate right of the building blocks, there is the area to which you can drag blocks to build a program. To the right of that, you see the  _stage_  where a cat stands. The stage is where your programming comes to life.
    
-   Scratch operates on a coordinate system as follows:
    
    ![scratch coordinate system](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/0/cs50Week0Slide167.png "scratch coordinate system")  Notice that the center of the stage is at coordinate (0,0). Right now, the cat’s position is at that same position.
